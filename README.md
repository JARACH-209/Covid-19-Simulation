# Covid-19-Simulation

Corona Virus (COVID-19) spreading simulation in a close community with mathematical scaling and probability scaled according to the spread of infection, revovery and deaths.

Simulations are available on youtube and Linkedin in form of a video.

Simulated visualisations showing the spreading of COVID-19 under different scenarios based on Random Walks.
There are 6 scenarios : 
1. Spreading with 100% movement and no recovery.
2. Spreading with 100% movement and recovery.
3. Spreading with 100% movement, recovery and deaths at 11% rate.
4. Spreading with 30% movement and no recovery.
5. Spreading with 30% movement and recovery.
6. Spreading with 30% movement, recovery and deaths at 11% rate.

What we need to observe is that what is the outcome after same period of time. At 100% movement all 11% die which are randomly chosen among all the particle, whereas at 30% movement only 4 particles die.

Visulaizations are made using Python3 and libraries like matplotlib, numpy, animation, pyplot, etc.
